### Project Summary
Our project is built on a recreational center DBMS and displayed with a GUI developed by Java Swing. Users can log into the system and select a branch to look at several things that the branch has, such as a list of bookables, a list of members signed up in the branch, a list of areas in the branch that a certain member can access etc. Users can also insert/ delete values (such as make/ delete bookings from the branch) to our program. Our program also delivers some complex querying methods such as displaying members that have accessed a public area before and the number of their total accesses.
